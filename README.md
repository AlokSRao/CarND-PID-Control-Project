## Reflection
### PID Controllers 
PID controllers is one of the most widely used feedback control algorithms. It stands for Proportional - Integral - Derivative Control. In this project, we implemented PID control to control the steering angle of a model car, given the cross track error(error between desired position on track and actual position)
###Effect of each term on steering
1.**Proportinal 'P' term** : The P term acts directly on the error, as the name suggests, the output signal is directly proportional to the error, in fact the out put is k_p * error, where kp is the proportional gain. A very high proportinal gain will make the system react faster however, it can also lead to instability. Another thing to note is that with just a proportional; controller, it is impossible to reduce the error to 0.
2.**Integral 'i' term** : The i term acts by accumlating the error that is generated over time. This error is then multiplied with k_i, the integral gain. It can be proven that the error term will always reduce to 0, as ling as k_i>0;
3.**Derivative 'd' term** : The d term acts on the the change in error, therby it acts as a counter agains large oscillations. 
###Tuning for this project:
I manually tuned the controller, and was able toe ensure it stayted within the track within a few iterations. However, it is far from perfect, and can definitely be improved.

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!
